Questions for Dan:
* Let me outline how I imagine the player interacting with the game:
  (level selection, play level, see achievements, choose level again, etc)
  What do you think?

* What do you think of the mechanic now?

* Web security - what do you want to do with it? (see below)

* What information do you want to record?
-> My Ideas
--> Subject Name
--> Subject ID
--> Date of Session
--> Session number
--> Trials/trial probabilities

* Let's talk about my future plans, and see if this makes sense
-> Add an introductory page explaining the game
-> Massive graphical improvements
--> Look and feel of whole thing
--> Animations
--> Decision signaling (i.e., giant arrows)
--> Hopefully decent-looking graphics
-->? Move score to an overhead view
-> Sound feedback
--> Positive sound for "benefit"
--> Negative sound for "obstacle"
-->? Additional feedback after making a "choice"
-> Dealing with choice refusal
-> Form for specifying trials
-> Data viewer
-> Recording + saving of data
-> Multiple levels
->? Achievements/High Scores
->? Secure communication
--> Options:
---> [Try SSL or secure connection w/ authentication somehow]
---> [Do everything with physical files]
---> [Only associate participant ID to data, keep real name offline]
---> [Save data locally, distribute script to forward it to server]
