Questions for Dan:
* Is it ok for the choice to be "go left or right", or should the choice be "red or blue" where red and blue are presented on different sides?

* How long will the participant play the game during the test?

* How many decisions do you want each participant to make in a session? In a discrete level (if that's important to you)?
