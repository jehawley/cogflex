Should consider changing 10 (and 11) to a constant everywhere that makes sense

Should consider moving config info to a data file

Should consider refactoring how levels are made (add 0 and length to secStops, give all things in waveQueues the same type, more loops, make a generic function that just take a waveQueues object)

Consider improving .csv build

Consider reducing + normalizing audio volumes

*Note - level 4 made of 84-93, it is also broken 
*Note - level 9 is with 94-107
*Note - level 10 is with 108- , *114, 115=finale
      -  108-114, 116-117, 118-123, 124
---------

In renderData
&  --Add new images
&  --Change the image count

In init - call to initTestValues
&  --Either get data before setting this up, or just set up all 10 levels and choose from among them later (probably the latter)

In saveInitialData -
&  --get levels to use.
&  --Set up all data collection (and possibly choose what levels to use)
  --Handle error of not setting participant data / choosing a level (perhaps have saveInitialData return true only on success, check it before proceeding).

In definitions - 
&  --change how data collection vars are initialized, add a field for levels

In handleResultsScreen -
&  --replace level count with queue
&  --Change what determines gameOver

In render.js
&  --Add remaining levels to initLevelImages
&  --Add powerups for new levels

In renderChooseLevelScreen
&  --Change EVERYTHING (sigh...)
  --Add level numbering to the ChooseLevel screen

In sendDataToServer
&  --Change to only iterate over levels that actually exist
  --Report the level to the server as an additional field

In updateLoop.js
&  --Add powerup effects for new levels

In levels.js
&  -- Fix hack in initTestValues
  -- Fix hack in buildLevels
  -- BUILD NEW LEVELS
  -- TEST NEW LEVELS

BUGS


*Can I actually send data to server?
